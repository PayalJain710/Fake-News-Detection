This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to develop models that can effectively differentiate between real and fake news
based on various textual and contextual features.
The visualizations are shown using different graphs,wordclouds and confusion matrices.
It also comapares the accuracy of LSTM,Logistic Regression,Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier to fetch out the best results.
Its Features are:
Text Processing: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and clean textual data.
Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from news articles, such as word frequencies, sentiment analysis, and syntactic patterns.
Machine Learning Models: Trains and evaluates various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, LSTM neural networks, and others.
Evaluation Metrics: Measures model performance using accuracy to assess effectiveness in detecting fake news.

The Setup used is:
Install Dependencies: Ensure all required libraries are installed. You can use pip to install them
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset of labeled news articles (real and fake) for training and testing the models. This may involve web scraping or using publicly available datasets.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise, tokenize text, remove stopwords, and perform feature engineering.
Model Training: Train machine learning and deep learning models on the preprocessed data to classify news articles as real or fake.
